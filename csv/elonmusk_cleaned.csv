The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy.

Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not.

Side boosters landing on droneships & center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M.

Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be & will if BFR takes longer than expected.

That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high.

According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter.

Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money.

Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good.

Spiral-winding is great for uniform thickness. We used that for the Hyperloop vacuum tunnel. However, Starship skin thickness will vary considerably according to loads.

~1750K is peak heating expected on about 20% of Starship for LEO entry, ~1600K on 20%. Rest drops below 1450K, so no heat shield needed. Radiative cooling at T^4 takes care of 60% of the ship. Another reason for steel.

Propellant was not deep cryo. CH4 & O2 were just barely below liquid temp at 1 bar. In theory, Raptor should do ~300 bar at deep cryo, provided everything holds together, which is far from certain. However, only 250 bar is needed for nominal operation of Starship/Super Heavy.

Very much so. There are 2.5B cars & trucks on Earth. Even replacing 1% of that fleet would require making 25M vehicles per year. Tesla will make over 500k cars in next 12 months, but that’s a mere 2% of 25M or 0.02% of global vehicle fleet. Car industry slow -> demand >> supply.

As a robotaxi, probably closer to 16 hours, accounting for empty legs, travel to charger/cleaning/service, wait times, etc. ~30 mile penalty most likely imo over ~120 paid miles. Impact is signicant for electricity cost, battery wear cost & larger range pack needed.

Intersections with complex traffic lights & shopping mall parking lots are the two biggest software challenges. Developer branch already mostly works in these scenarios, but massive effort required to get to 99.9999% safety.

Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won’t diverge until Q4, as it’s limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.

Straw man fallacy. To appreciate, your car just needs to be worth more than you paid for it, so probably ~$75k is enough if you bought a 3. FSD will be bundled in all cars (important point). Something is not a commodity if you can’t make enough of them & we won’t be able to.

Everything happens so fast. It’s such a different paradigm that applying aircraft concepts to rockets is almost like applying shipping concepts to aircraft. Travels 10,000 km in 30 mins.

Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven’t moved far even if a is high. At ~6g thrust, you’ll only travel ~0.03m in 100 ms. Pressure wave (aka explosion) with liquid rockets is low, as ox & fuel are poorly mixed. If you can fly out of it, you’re prob ok.

There aren’t really meant to be “Tesla incentives”, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives. Overarching principle, however, is same deal for all.

Should note that these product mix & logistics errors also results in regional *undersupply*, eg UK & Ireland right now, but we don’t raise the prices even so. The intent, at any given moment in time, is: heads we lose, tails buyers win.

At end of quarter, there is always some error in product mix allocation between the roughly 40 global regions, due to planning mistakes & logistics problems (Earth is a big place). Small changes in prices are needed to correct local supply/demand imbalances.

Exactly. For reusable heatshield, minimize peak heating. For ablative/expendable, minimize total heat. Therefore reusable like Starship wants lift during high Mach reentry for lower peak, but higher total heat.

We can prob reduce width by an inch & maybe reduce length by 6+ inches without losing on utility or esthetics. Min height is below 75 inches when air suspension set to low. Will post exact number soon.

He’s def wrong. Solar power is a Gigawatt per square km! All you need is a 100 by 100 mile patch in a deserted corner of Arizona, Texas or Utah (or anywhere) to more than power the entire USA.

Many ways to solve this problem, but the power requirements are much higher than aircraft control surfaces. When moving giant body flaps rapidly, achieving high power is much harder than high torque.

Moving to an enclosed (fairly) clean room environment for SN2 in Jan, although, unlike aluminum, stainless steel welding is not super sensitive. Our main issue here in Boca is that it can get very windy, which affects weld arc & steel melt pool.

Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant. However, the tanks do expand under pressure, creating a bit more volume. Keeping propellant super cold has a big effect on density of ~10% in case of CH4.

Densifying hydrogen is difficult, as its liquid temp is close to absolute zero. Much easier with CH4, which is an underappreciated advantage. Cooling O2 is good too, but becomes operationally difficult at N2 liquid temp, as air is ~78% N2. Entire system wants to drip air!

This isn’t quite correct. An orbital rocket needs precision that’s 3X to 4X better than a water tower, so super precise parts, fixtures & welding are needed. Suborbital is much more forgiving.

That said, although substantial capital & engineering is required to achieve extreme precision, marginal production cost of the primary structure should actually be *less* than a water tower, because it’s built inside a factory in volume.

Unmodified water tower machines do not work well for orbital rockets, as mass efficiency is critical for the latter, but not the former. Hopper, for example, was made of 12.5mm steel vs 4mm for SN1 orbital design. Optimized skins will be <2mm in places across a 9000mm diameter.

No problem. Snow and ice tend to slide off the Tesla SolarGlass due to lower surface roughness, so accumulates less than a normal roof. Even so, it’s very strong and can be walked on without breaking the glass tiles.

There will be a common area in the forward section with a big window like this. It will be a lot heavier than steel, but not dangerous. Consider astronauts on the moon with a very thin windowed helmet. They were fine.

F9 iteration slowed down as payloads became too important to risk. Little change is expected going forward with F9/FH or Dragon. Starship production & thus iterative improvement will be much faster than Falcon. Driving hard for fully reusable orbital flight this year!

It’s mostly to balance the ship during entry. After delivering satellites, the front is light & back is heavy due to engines & landing legs.

Starship + Super Heavy propellant mass is 4800 tons (78% O2 & 22% CH4). I think we can get propellant cost down to ~$100/ton in volume, so ~$500k/flight. With high flight rate, probably below $1.5M fully burdened cost for 150 tons to orbit or ~$10/kg.

A fully & rapidly reusable orbital rocket is fundamental to extending life beyond Earth. Propellant cost is roughly a 1000th of vehicle cost (unless using a foolish propellant). Same principle as cars, planes, boats, etc.

We could never reach 380 Isp with RP/kerosene. CH4 has higher Isp potential on paper, but even better in practice. With CH4, you can reach >99% of max theoretical combustion efficiency, but RP is ~97% on a good day & requires desooting of turbines between flights.

Important technical note: due to higher O/F of CH4 vs RP1 (oxygen is dense) & significant density increase of subcooled CH4 (plus no common dome insulation needed), plus cryo strength bump of CH4, tank mass of CH4/O2 stage is almost same as RP1/O2.

It’s counter-intuitive, but Raptor has so much thrust at high Isp with liquid (high density) propellant & pump-fed (light tanks), that it beats hot gas for the flip. That said, hot gas beats the heck out of N2 for orbital manuevers & stabilizing ship if landing in high winds!

Raptor reached 230 mT-F (over half a million pounds of thrust) at peak pressure with some damage, so this version of the engine can probably sustain ~210 tons. Should have a 250+ ton engine in about 6 to 9 months. Target for booster is 7500 tons (16.5 million pounds) of thrust.

Antibody half-life for cov2 is very short. In a study that SpaceX did working with Harvard epidemiology, it appears to be as low as 2 or 3 weeks. Nonetheless, reinfection rates are very low & symptoms are minor, perhaps due to memory T cells

Worth noting that thrust is only slightly higher with the big bell nozzle version. Larger bell is primarily for efficiency in vacuum. Aiming for 380+ sec Isp for RVac long-term. Initially likely to be ~372.

Over time, outer 20 will have ~300 tons of thrust & inner 8 ~210, so roughly 7500 tons total at sea level or 1.5 T/W for booster+ship

The outer ring of booster engines (20 of 28) have no TVC actuators. Steering control comes from center 8 TVC & differential throttle of outer engines. By any measure, the high thrust variant of Raptor will probably have the high T/W of any engine ever.

Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people & cargo around Earth (also to moon & Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It’s just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian.

Tesla FSD computer’s dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes — they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails.

To the best of my knowledge, literally zero equipment was usable without major repairs or upgrades. 

Most of the factory had no equipment at all! Even light bulbs were missing in some areas.

The number of PCR amplification cycles required to detect the virus is a rough indicator of your viral load. From what I can gather, you’re probably not infectious above 30 & you probably are below 25. Sound about right?

Just spoke directly to a testing lab. Their main PCR search is for the N1 gene, unique to cov2. N3 is also sought, but is generic to other sars viruses. High PCR cycle count *does* give false positives, but they believe accuracy is good below 30 cycles & 40 cycles is their max.

Merlin is a strong local maximum design, but kerosene is suboptimal fuel, no matter what you do. 

What matters is cost per ton to Mars. CH4 is the only choice imo. Important: O2/CH4 allows OF ratio of ~3.5 vs ~2.5 for kerosene, so ~78% of propellant is oxygen.

Perhaps slightly more confident, but it’s essential to view this as output vs time. As with all manufacturing, especially new technology, output will follow an S-curve. Very slow at first, but increasing exponentially, then linear, then logarithmic.

Strange, if true. 

- Tesla already uses iron-phosphate for medium range cars made in our Shanghai factory.

- A monocell is electrochemically impossible, as max voltage is ~100X too low. Maybe they meant cells bonded together, like our structural battery pack?

Seems odd that the opposition group is from BMW’s home state of Baveria. That‘s very far from Brandenburg, where Tesla is building the Gigafactory.

The thing we call money is just an information system for labor allocation. 

What actually matters is making goods & providing services. 

We should look at currencies from an information theory standpoint.

T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W.

Yes, but engines have a min throttle point where there is flameout risk, so landing on 3 engines means high thrust/weight (further away from hover point), which is also risky

Doge appears to be inflationary, but is not meaningfully so (fixed # of coins per unit time), whereas BTC is arguably deflationary to a fault.

Transaction speed of Doge should ideally be a few orders of magnitude faster.

An email saying you have gold is not the same as having gold. You might as well have crypto.

Money is just data that allows us to avoid the inconvenience of barter.

To be clear, I am *not* an investor, I am an engineer. I don’t even own any publicly traded stock besides Tesla. 

However, when fiat currency has negative real interest, only a fool wouldn’t look elsewhere.

Tesla’s action is not directly reflective of my opinion. Having some Bitcoin, which is simply a less dumb form of liquidity than cash, is adventurous enough for an S&P500 company.

There will be a gap before the next release, but then it will be a step change better.

Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. 

Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time.

If 2021 manifest is met, SpaceX will do ~75% of total Earth payload to orbit with Falcon.

A single Starship is designed to do in a day what all rockets on Earth currently do in a year. 

Even so, ~1000 Starships will take ~20 years to build a self-sustaining city on Mars.

There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. 

Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff.

Looks like engine 2 had issues on ascent & didn’t reach operating chamber pressure during landing burn, but, in theory, it wasn’t needed. 

Something significant happened shortly after landing burn start. Should know what it was once we can examine the bits later today.

Next major technology rev is at SN20. Those ships will be orbit-capable with heat shield & stage separation system. Ascent success probability is high.

However, SN20+ vehicles will probably need many flight attempts to survive Mach 25 entry heating & land intact.

Goal is to get BN2 with engines on orbital pad before end of April. It might even be orbit-capable if we are lucky.

Sensors are a bitstream and cameras have several orders of magnitude more bits/sec than radar (or lidar). 

Radar must meaningfully increase signal/noise of bitstream to be worth complexity of integrating it. 

As vision processing gets better, it just leaves radar far behind.

Essentially, passive Autopilot (car intervenes only when crash probability is high) cuts crashes in half. 

Active Autopilot (car is driving itself) cuts crashes in half again. 

Doesn’t mean there are no crashes, but, on balance, Autopilot is unequivocally safer.

Newest units can probably do as much as 10kW continuous & double that in peak power at 30C ambient temp.

In house power vernacular, this translates to ~80LRA (soft start of 3.5 ton HVAC). Two Powerwalls would double this, three would triple, etc.

Any given publication is going to have wide range of views, albeit vast majority of stories about any subject are negative, perhaps reflecting innate human biases.

I think we’re maybe a month or two away from wide beta. But these things are hard to predict accurately. 

The work we had to do for pure vision driving was needed for FSD, so much more progress has been made than it would seem.

Bitcoin is actually highly centralized, with supermajority controlled by handful of big mining (aka hashing) companies. 

A single coal mine in Xinjiang flooded, almost killing miners, and Bitcoin hash rate dropped 35%. Sound “decentralized” to you?

That’s where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs & mid range cars.

Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. 

Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.

That said, it’s obv not a long-term issue.

Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used.

Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially.

The Plaid carbon-wrapped motor is arguably the most advanced motor on Earth outside of maybe a lab somewhere. We have to keep some secrets! 

We have a few ideas for increasing torque & max rpm even further for new Roadster. Definitely fun & exciting engineering ahead!

Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion. 

Preload is also helpful for maintaining precise gap to stator.

Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration.

Doubling diameter increases mass 4X, but difficulty of simultaneously building & launching rocket of that size is >>4X. 

In retrospect, <9m diameter for Starship might have been wise. Current size is ~5200 ton stack mass & ~7500 ton-F thrust, which is more than double Saturn V.

Once you have rapidly reusable rockets of sufficient size to carry >100 tons of payload, it is not clear that cost per ton to orbit/moon/Mars improves with a larger rocket. 

Aircraft, for example, have moved away from 747/A380 to 777, which has ~100 tons of payload.

When we need strange training examples, eg half a car on highway, Tesla sim delivers. 

Also, accidents on Autopilot are becoming rarer, so we need more close call examples.

For safety tests, Autopilot sees dummy far away. Emergency braking only needed for distracted drivers.

L/D makes quite a big difference. We do care about lift for Starship much more than Dragon, as lower peak heating is needed for reusability of heat shield.

Dragon prefers high peak, low total heat load, as it is driven by tile heat pulse reaching bondline while under parachutes.

Center engines on ship will be same as booster engines. This is basically Raptor 2.

Raptor Vacuum would be only variant. Tbd as to whether to commonize R-Vac with Raptor 2 (more thrust), keep same or tighten throat (more Isp). 

Adding 3 more R-Vac to ship with max Isp maybe …

2021 Tesla Model S Plaid: Feel the Force—0-60 in 2 Seconds
Though largely unchanged on the outside, the new Model S is a technical tour de force: the fastest, hardest-accelerating, most aero-efficient production sedan ever. Dan Neil takes a road trip.

To be frank, there is always some chance that Cybertruck will flop, because it is so unlike anything else. 

I don’t care. I love it so much even if others don’t. 

Other trucks look like copies of the same thing, but Cybertruck looks like it was made by aliens from the future.

Not bad, although new Model S has more range & faster charging. 3 & Y should use long range version, as Performance version is meant for max speed & handling, not max range.

Tapering down charge rate is simply a physical thing that has to happen, as lithium ions bounce around what is an increasingly full “parking lot”. 

Just like a car parking lot, where it takes longer to find a spot when the lot is almost full.

More ground stations & less foolish packet routing will make the biggest differences.

Looking at speed of light as ~300km per millisecond & satellite altitude of ~550km, average photon round-trip time is only ~10ms, so a lot of silly things have to happen to drive ping >20ms.

That’s a low bar. Carmakers have never valued software engineering highly, although VW is trying to change that. 

I personally wrote software for 20 years & have huge respect for software engineers. Tesla is on par with best software companies & is leader in real world AI.

Normally, competitive pressure would force Apple to lower fees, but Apple & Android have a duopoly on phones. When interface familiarity is taken into account, it’s basically a monopoly.

That’s arguably a security issue, but  allowing companies to use other payment options, especially for in-app purchases would be fair.

As soon as they allowed that, they would have to lower their fees.

Indeed. Grid fin designs clearly work, but do they maximize payload? Good chance that they do not. 

Something with much more drag to reduce terminal velocity & so reduce landing propellant might have better performance. Not sure.

Over time, we might get orbital payload up to ~150 tons with full reusabity. If Starship then launched as an expendable, payload would be ~250 tons. What isn’t obvious from this chart is that Starship/Super Heavy is much denser than Saturn V.

There is a reason no fully reusable orbital rocket has been built – it’s an insanely hard problem.

16 flights is extremely unlikely. Starship payload to orbit is ~150 tons , so max of 8 to fill 1200 ton tanks of lunar Starship.

Without flaps & heat shield, Starship is much lighter. Lunar landing legs don’t add much (1/6 gravity). May only need 1/2 full, ie 4 tanker flights.

However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 & has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.

Starship will be crushingly cost-effective for Earth orbit or moon missions as soon as it’s operational & rapid reuse is happening. 

Mars is a lot harder, because Earth & Mars only align every 26 months, so ship reuse is limited to ~dozen times over 25 to 30 year life of ship.

Btw, there’s a slight error with forward flap design. Moving section is needed for control, but passive section is counter-productive, as it pushes nose backwards.

No, bottom static aero pushes engine section back, counteracting Starship’s low center of mass on reentry caused by the engine section. 

Aiming for 60 to 70 deg angle of attack during high heating portion of flight. Don’t want to reenter with engines blasted by plasma.

Our intent with this pack is that product experience is roughly equivalent between nickel & iron.

I’d personally slightly opt for iron pack, as it wants to be charged to 100%, whereas nickel prefers ~90%.

FSD Beta 9.2 is actually not great imo, but Autopilot/AI team is rallying to improve as fast as possible. 

We’re trying to have a single stack for both highway & city streets, but it requires massive NN retraining.

Processing is not an issue. Lasers links alleviate ground station constraints, so data can go from say Sydney to London through space, which is ~40% faster speed of light than fiber & shorter path. 

Also, no need for ground stations everywhere. Arctic will have great bandwidth!

Yes. 

Physics of large cells means distance from cooling loop to center of cell is high, so harder to prevent hotspots.

Then, pressure & heat released from large cell in weak bag make it impossible to stop whole pack from burning.

Pretty basic.

There are vast amounts of iron (and lithium) on Earth, but much less nickel. 

For global industry to scale battery production to ~10 TWh/year, it needs to be mostly iron.

Higher energy density of Nickel only needed for very long range vehicles & aircraft.

Large incumbent carmakers sell their cars at low to zero true margin. Most of their profit is selling replacement parts to their fleet, of which 70% to 80% are past warranty.

FSD 10 predicts height from video pixels directly, without needing to classify groups of pixels into objects. 

In principle, even if a UFO crashed on the road right in front of you, it would still avoid the debris.

Long chain hydrocarbons, like kerosene, have excellent volumetric energy density, but what you really want for rockets is best way to bind hydrogen, which is CH4.

Exactly. Giga Shanghai makes cars for export in first half of quarter, then cars for far away parts of China, then cars for nearby parts of China. 

Net result is a crazy wave of deliveries end of quarter. It is tough on our team, so we’re hoping to reduce the wave in Q4 & Q1.

If tiles are not super thin, you get hot plasma “waterfalling” off edges of tiles, creating hotspots. 

That said, I’m not entirely convinced that this couldn’t be done with several overlapping scales of metal sheet with an insulator between scale armor & primary structure.

Vision became so good that radar actually reduced SNR, so radar was turned off. 

Humans drive with eyes & biological neural nets, so makes sense that cameras & silicon neural nets are only way to achieve generalized solution to self-driving.

Sorry to Tesla beta users for the trouble! Issue turned out to be power saving mode interacting with FSD. 

Our internal QA fleet didn’t see this, because cars are constantly in use, so very rarely enter power saving mode. Internal QA will obv test this case going forward.

Not recently. What matters imo is lowering fees, decreasing block time & increasing block size. A single layer network with exchanges as de facto layer 2 seems like the simplest solution for a medium of exchange.

US national debt is ~$28,900 billion or ~$229k per taxpayer.

Even taxing all “billionaires” at 100% would only make a small dent in that number, so obviously the rest must come from the general public. This is basic math.

Spending is the real problem.

GM & Chrysler were bailed out (money never repaid), but Tesla was not.

Crucial Tesla investment actually came from Daimler in 2009, from which they did very well.

Tesla received govt energy efficiency loan in 2010, by which time capital markets reopened. Loan was repaid early.

Tentative plan is 98 & above starts uploading Friday afternoon next week.

If we see any concerns, uploads will pause while we investigate, so might take a few days before everyone with 98 safety gets beta 10.4.

10.4 improves left turns across fast traffic & stopping for gates.

If any of this is based on Hertz, I’d like to emphasize that no contract has been signed yet.

This will be really important one day. 

Much is made of meteor impacts that destroyed most life on Earth, but there were far more that “merely” destroyed a continent.

If we are able to make life self-sustaining on Mars, we will have passed one of the greatest filters. That then sets us up to become interstellar.

Earth is ~4.5B years old, but life is still not multiplanetary and it is extremely uncertain how much time is left to become so.

High-performance code is in C using our own compiler to maximize frame rate. We use Python with custom libraries for fast prototyping, then convert to C for fast execution.

New software is run against real-world video & our world simulator to evaluate performance, then QA.

Here's my conversation with @elonmusk. His 3rd time on the podcast. This one was epic.

Elon and the amazing SpaceX and Tesla teams have inspired the world, in a time when it is needed most.

Thank you for giving people hope about the future.

Maybe part of why traditional media outlets are so negative is because old habits die hard? They so rarely even try to be positive.

Big changes may impact output for a day or two. Reversing out big changes or unexpected parts shortages are what impact several days.

I’m a fan of Rust. Clearly scales well, given that Discord uses it.

For max performance, however, nothing beats tight C with a customized compiler on specialized hardware. Important for max frame rate on vehicle inference computer.

While it is tempting to focus on one of those arenas as the “hard one”, in fact they are all difficult & important. Tight C & custom compiler too.

An inference computer optimized for energy efficiency, reliability & long life is also critical. Can’t just jam GPUs in the trunk.
